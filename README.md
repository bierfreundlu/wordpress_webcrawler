webcrawler that returns pages created with wordpress


" I would like a python script that I can use to find websites built with wordpress. I would like to be able to search via keyword if possible. It can be powered by Google or whatever source would be best. I would like it to create a CSV file with all the site URLs found. Python would be preferable."
